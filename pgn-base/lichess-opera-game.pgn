{ The famous game played between Paul Morphy and (consulting together over their moves) the Duke of Brunswick and Comte Isouard de Vauvenargues in the Duke's box during the opera Norma in 1858 in Paris. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 { Black plays the Philidor defence, and all is about to go awry for black. The lichess analysis engine shows a preference for 3 ...exd4, but instead black decides to try and defend the e pawn indirectly by pinning white's N to the Q. } 3... Bg4 4. dxe5 Bxf3 { If 4 ...dxe5 then 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6. Nxe5 and white is up a piece. Nevertheless, there are alternatives to this move such as 4 ... Nc6 which actually is better for black. } 5. Qxf3 dxe5 6. Bc4 { Putting pressure on the weak f7 square. } 6... Nf6 { A seemingly wise move, developing a piece while also protecting the f7 pawn. In fact 6 ... Qf6 would have been preferable because, although it does not prevent what comes next, it would allow black, after white's 7. Qb3 to maintain counterplay with a later ...Bc5 bringing pressure to bear on white's weak f2 square. } 7. Qb3 { Maintaining the pressure on f7. } 7... Qe7 { The only way for black to keep f7 safe and preserve the ability to castle. But this blocks the King's bishop in and will prevent black from castling away to safety. I wonder if Morphy saw that outcome and played Qb3 for that reason? } 8. Nc3 { After reading a few commentaries about this move, I learnt that Morphy chooses development over material. He could have picked up a pawn with 8. Qxb7. } 8... c6 { Readying b5. I would have hightailed my B on c4 out of there, but not Morphy. He continues with his development. That's why Morphy will be remembered and I play such terrible chess. } 9. Bg5 b5 { Black attempts to drive away the B on c4 to take the pressure off of f7. But at this point it is almost over for black. It triggers a series of sacrifices by Morphy which leaves nothing on the board but what he needed for a beautiful mate. I would love to know how far ahead he saw this combination and whether, at the point of this sacrifice, he could already see the mate. } { Black attempts to drive away the B on c4 to take the pressure off of f7.

O-O-O { Developing and applying pressure to the d7 N. Black now has two knights pinned. Morphy continues sacrificing pieces. } 12... Rd8 13. Rxd7 Rxd7 14. Rd1 { This I assume is an attempt to unpin the f6 N and allow it to defend the R on d7, but the attempt fails. } 14... Qe6 15. Bxd7+ Nxd7 16. Qb8+ { A gorgeous Q sacrifice to bring about a surprising mate. } 16... Nxb8 17. Rd8# { The first game (and so far the only game) I have memorised. Reposted here in part because it is fun and instructive and in remaining part to refresh and further lock it into my memory. } *
